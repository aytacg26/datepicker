# datepicker
On this study, I started to create datepicker which will be possible to use in any language. I tried to create something like HTML5 options (Date, DateTime and Months) and this will be set with the settings object of the datepicker.js file. Not compeleted yet but each day, it will be updated until it is ready to use in any project.
