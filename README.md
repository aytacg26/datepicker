# datepicker
On this study, I started to create datepicker which will be possible to use in any language. I tried to create something like HTML5 options (Date, DateTime and Months) and this will be set with the settings object of the datepicker.js file. Not compeleted yet but each day, it will be updated until it is ready to use in any project. Currently, it consists of 7 languages for months and for every single point any of 7 languages will be possible to set from settings object language prop by using language code (en-English, es-Spanish, fr-French, de-German or tr-Turkish)
